# ComboZ: Build, Share, and Practice Combos

ComboZ is a web app designed for Dragon Ball FighterZ enthusiasts who want to create, share, and practice combos. With our combo builder, users can log in and access a library of all characters and combos created by the community. The app's main feature is the ability to use Chrome's Picture-in-Picture (PiP) API, allowing users to open any combo on the site as a PiP window and overlay it directly over their game for seamless practice.
